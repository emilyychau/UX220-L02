        <p>I recently re-read the novel Will Grayson, Will Grayson. It is co-written by John Green and David Levithan.
            The story is about two teenagers, both named Will Grayson, living in separate cities in the Chicago suburbs
            of Illinois.</p>
        <p>The book is written from the perspective of both Will Graysons; the odd numbered chapters are authored by
            Green. He writes from the point of view of Will Grayson 1, the first and only, male straight-identifying
            member of his high school’s Gay-Straight Alliance. The even numbered chapters are authored by Levithan, and
            are from the point of view of gay Will, also known as Will Grayson 2. The Will Graysons cross paths in the
            middle of the novel, their stories and interactions slowly become entangled.</p>
        <p>There is also a spin-off book that goes in depth about the autobiographical musical written by the character
            Tiny Cooper. It’s titled <i>Hold Me Closer: The Tiny Cooper Story</i>. Although I have owned this book in paperback
            for several years, it sits on a bookshelf in my childhood bedroom waiting to be read.</p>
